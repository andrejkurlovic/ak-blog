    <p>A senior cybersecurity and infrastructure leader with 20+ years of experience building the secure, scalable operations that underpin business growth in enterprise, retail, and automation.</p>

    <p>As CISO and DPO for one of the UK’s fastest-growing retailers, I built the security and privacy functions from the ground up. My mission was to create a program that didn't just protect, but accelerated the business. This approach secured thousands of assets and empowered 27,000+ colleagues, all while supporting the company's pace of opening a new store nearly every week.</p>

    <p>My approach is straightforward: Simplify complexity, lead with clarity, and build trust.</p>

    <p>I use this 'keep-it-clear-and-simple' mindset to build high-performing teams and design resilient systems.</p>

    <h2>CORE EXPERTISE</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>► Cybersecurity Strategy &amp; Program Development</li>
      <li>► Risk Management &amp; Governance (GRC)</li>
      <li>► Threat Intelligence &amp; Offensive Security</li>
      <li>► Incident Response &amp; Business Resilience</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I'm particularly passionate about mentoring the next generation of security leaders and exploring the impact of AI on threat intelligence.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, I believe security isn’t a barrier. It’s a fundamental part of how a modern business thrives—and my job is to make sure it works that way.</p>
