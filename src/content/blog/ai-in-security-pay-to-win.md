I’m genuinely excited about all the **AI and ML features** vendors are building into security platforms — they’re helping with detection, correlation, and automation in ways that used to take teams of analysts.

But lately, something feels off.

### 🎟️ The Token Trap
The new **token-based billing** models have turned predictable licensing into a **coin toss**.

Run a few queries and suddenly half your tokens are gone.  
And the worst part? No one can answer simple questions like:
- Who used them?  
- What burned through them?  
- Why a *basic* search costs more than a complex one?

### 💸 From License to Loot Box
This consumption model feels less like a security tool and more like a **pay-to-win mobile game** — constant micro-charges, unpredictable usage, and dashboards that feel like in-app stores.

You want a new skin? 💰 Pay.  
You want to run a query? 💰 Pay.  
Otherwise, your expensive, AI-enabled platform quietly turns back into a pumpkin 🎃.

### ⚖️ The Bigger Question
AI should be **amplifying value**, not introducing billing anxiety.  
If the cost of asking a question about a threat becomes a budget discussion, we’ve lost the plot.

I’m curious — is this just me?  
How are you budgeting for or managing this new **token-based AI billing** model in your environments?  
I’d love to hear how others are balancing innovation and cost predictability.
