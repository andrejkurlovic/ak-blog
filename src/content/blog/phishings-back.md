Is it just me, or is **phishing getting absolutely brutal again?**

No more sketchy “Nigerian prince” emails — now the fake ones look *perfectly real.*  
(Though if you *are* a real prince and want to contact me, I’m down 🤪)

**Generative AI has completely changed the game** in our inboxes.  
Tone, grammar, and context are spot-on — and that human “gut check” is harder than ever.

### 🎣 The Questions I Keep Asking
👉 Is **user awareness training** still effective?  
Or are we flogging a dead horse — training people to spot red flags that no longer exist?

👉 What about **AI-powered gateways** like *Abnormal Security* or *Microsoft Defender for Office 365* —  
are they truly helping, or just another shiny promise while the old if/then filters fall behind?

### 💭 My Take
Phishing today isn’t just about *emails* — it’s about **trust signals**.  
Attackers mimic tone, structure, and even company workflows.  
The best defences now combine:  
- **Behavioural detection** (context over keywords),  
- **Real-time identity validation**, and  
- **Continuous reinforcement** — not once-a-year CBTs.

We’re moving from *spot the typo* to *understand intent.*
